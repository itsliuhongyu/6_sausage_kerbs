# 6_sausage_kerbs

# What is this?

This project investigates the history of 'sausage kerbs' that saw their hay-days during the early 2010s but are currently under criticism due to safety issues. [Read the full story here](https://itsliuhongyu.github.io/6_sausage_kerbs/).

# Gather the data:

The data of this project is a combiniation of manual research and webscraping. 

1. Race tracks with sausage kerbs

This was all made through manual labor as there is no database regarding how many sausage kerbs each race track has anywhere in the internet. I went thorugh the list of racetracks that F1 held events in since 2000, and identified those are known for having kerbs at specifc corners as well as those where crash happened involving a racecar launched into the air by these kerbs.

2. Off track Penalty

Through sraping the [F1 Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html), I was able to get information about off-track limit penalties in since 2014. Then, I used the data to identify the race tracks that most of these penalties were issued in and cross reference with the race tracks with the most sausage kerbs.

# Analyze Data:

The quantitative analysis of this project is limited to identify which racetrack had the most number of out of track penalties.

However, with the help of videos, I was able to create some running throughs of some crashes where the sausage kerbs are invoved.

# What can be improved?

The original plan of the project hoped to use YOLO to identify all the suasage kerbs in each racetracks using satellite images, and create a correlation model between kerb numbers and violation numbers. However, it is not realistic as training an AI model takes far more than three weeks of labor. 

Also, this project does not provide any further insight regarding how to make sauasge kerbs less dangerous as there is near to no additonal information released by FIA or any of the race teams involved. It will take far more effort to create an in-depth piece regarding this topic and it will most likely be done by a professional in the topic.
